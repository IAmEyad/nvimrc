# nvim dotfiles

My nvim setup based off [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/neovimrc/tree/master) setup.
Followed his video [0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)

# Differences/Changes
- Uses [Harpoon2](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon/tree/harpoon2)
- Uses [lsp-zero.nvim v3](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim/tree/v3.x)
- Some different keybinds (I'm on QWERTY he's on Dvorak)

# Some additional requirements
- Some of the LSPs require `NPM` and `Node`, make sure you have those setup.
- Some of the LSPs require `unzip` to be installed.

# Things that'll probably change
Since I'm fairly new to using neovim as my primary editor, here are somethings I'll likely change:

- Keybinds
- Plugins
- LSPs
